# CSS3 and Jquery presentation with demo
## A Jackson Area Web and App Developer Meetup Presentation

This is a presentation given at the Jackson Area Web and App Developer meetup on 6/26/19.  The presentation was created using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and can be found [here](index.html).

The completed demo is [here](entergy_animation/entergyanimation.html).

The demo uses CSS3 for the animations and jQuery as a framework for the javascript. The jQuery is not absolutely necessary but the CSS3 is vital.
